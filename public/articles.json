    "title": "Difference between SQL and NoSQL",
    "content": "SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL. <br/> Most SQL databases can be scaled vertically, by increasing the processing power of existing hardware. NoSQL databases use a master-slave architecture which scales better horizontally, with additional servers or nodes.<br/>SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance).<br/>Great support is available for all SQL database from their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments but for some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments.

    "content": "JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.<br/>Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key.<br/> 1. User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook.<br/> 2. Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed using either a secret salt or a private key.<br/>3. User's Client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP Authorization header.<br/>4. Resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key.",

    "content": "1. NodeJS<br/>NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development. It is mostly used on the server-side. Nodejs is written in C, C++ and Javascript.<br/>2. JavaScript<br/>Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as JS. It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the ECMA script. Javascript is a high-level programming language that uses the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype inheritance. Javascript is used in frontend development. It is the upgraded version of ECMA script that uses Chromeâ€™s V8 engine written in C++. ",
