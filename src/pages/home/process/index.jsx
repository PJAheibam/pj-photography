        Wedding in Bangladesh is one of the events which is celebrated with
        great fanfare. And naturally, every couple does a lot of pre-planning
        for this special day. Respecting their emotion, we first discuss with
        all our clients, know their requirements, and then start working on the
        project together as partners.
